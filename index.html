<p>Hello! Assuming you're not here looking for government secrets, you're likely here because you know that the Internet is a bit...weird. It feels corrupt, almost as if something is going on behind the curtains...<br> My name is Jöel Kinnunen, and I'm on a journey to find out what the big deal is. Everytime I connect to Mojave!, I write about my experiences inside it, all of the goods, all of the bads, and certainly all of the uglies.<br> If you can stomach it, you can accompany me on my journey by reading it below.</p><br>
